"""Let's consider vectors consisting of only ones and zeros. Let us also
assume an additional convention for representing such a vector. For
example, a vector:
U = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] we will present as a sequence:
'01101010'
For the vectors so defined, we can determine the Hamming distance. The
Hamming distance of
vectors u and v is the number of elements where the vectors u and v are
different.
Example: The Hamming distance of the vectors ‘110010’ , ' 1010000 ' is
equal to 3.
A function called hamming_distance() is implemented that returns the
Hamming distance of two vectors:
 def hamming_distance(u, v):
    if len(u) != len(v):
        raise ValueError('Both vectors must be the same length.')
    distance = 0
    for i in range(len(u)):
        if u[i] != v[i]:
            distance += 1
    return distance
        The weight of the vector u is the Hamming distance of this vector from
the zero vector. So in the case of vector ' 1001001 ' its weight is equal to the
Hamming distance of vector 110010011 from vector '0000000' .
Implement a function called hamming_weight() that returns the weight of
the vector. In the solution, you can use the hamming_distance( ) function. It
is also worth paying attention to a
slightly simpler implementation. The weight of a vector is equal to the
number of ones in the vector."""
